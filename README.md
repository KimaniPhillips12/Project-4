# Project-4

# Introduction
Our objective for this project was to train and evaluate various machine learning models to determine which deep learning model could effectively learn and predict a book's genre based on its plot summary.

# Models

1. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):
Process: BERT tokenizes text into subwords or word pieces, and then embeds each token into a high-dimensional vector space using pre-trained word embeddings. These embeddings are then processed through multiple layers of Transformer blocks to capture contextual information. The final hidden states of certain tokens or the pooled output are used as features for downstream tasks.
Libraries:
- transformers (formerly known as pytorch-transformers): This library provides pre-trained BERT models and tokenizers for both PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- tensorflow or torch: Depending on the implementation, you'll use TensorFlow or PyTorch to work with BERT models.

2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
Process: LSTM processes text by tokenizing it into words or characters, converting each token into a numerical representation (e.g., word embeddings), and then feeding these representations into the LSTM cells. The LSTM cells use their internal memory mechanisms to capture dependencies and patterns in sequential data.
Libraries:
tensorflow or torch: Both TensorFlow and PyTorch provide implementations of LSTM cells and layers for building recurrent neural networks.
keras: If using TensorFlow, you can also use the Keras API, which provides a high-level interface for building neural networks, including LSTM models.
SVC (Support Vector Classifier):
Process: SVC doesn't directly convert text into numerical data like neural network models. Instead, text data needs to be pre-processed and transformed into numerical features (e.g., bag-of-words representation or TF-IDF vectors) using techniques like tokenization and vectorization. These numerical features are then fed into the SVC model for training and prediction.
Libraries:
scikit-learn: This library provides implementations of SVC and various text preprocessing tools such as CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer for converting text data into numerical features.
Logistic Regression:
Process: Similar to SVC, logistic regression requires text data to be pre-processed and transformed into numerical features using techniques like tokenization and vectorization. The numerical features are then used as input to the logistic regression model, which learns to predict the probability of each class.
Libraries:
scikit-learn: You can use the LogisticRegression class from scikit-learn for building logistic regression models. Pre-processing tools like CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer can also be used for text data transformation.
Naive Bayes:
Process: Naive Bayes classifiers work directly with text data represented as bag-of-words or TF-IDF vectors. Text data is pre-processed and converted into numerical features using techniques like tokenization and vectorization. These features are then used as input to the Naive Bayes classifier, which calculates class probabilities based on Bayes' theorem.
Libraries:
scikit-learn: This library provides implementations of various Naive Bayes classifiers such as MultinomialNB and BernoulliNB, along with pre-processing tools like CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer.
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):
Process: XGBoost operates on structured/tabular data, so text data needs to be pre-processed and converted into numerical features using techniques like bag-of-words or TF-IDF representation. Once the text data is transformed into numerical features, these features are used as input to the XGBoost model, which builds an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions.
Libraries:
xgboost: This library provides an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting algorithms, including XGBoost. Pre-processing tools like CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn can be used for text data transformation.
In summary, while neural network models like BERT and LSTM have built-in mechanisms to process and learn from raw text data, traditional machine learning models like SVC, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost require pre-processing and transformation of text data into numerical features before training the models. Each approach has its advantages and is suitable for different types of text data and tasks.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): BERT is a type of deep learning model that is specifically designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It uses a Transformer architecture, which allows it to understand the context of words in a sentence by considering both the left and right context simultaneously.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. It has a memory cell that can store information over time, allowing it to learn patterns in sequential data. LSTM is commonly used for sequential data tasks such as time series forecasting, speech recognition, language translation, and text generation.

SVC (Support Vector Classifier): SVC is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space. SVC is a powerful classification algorithm that is widely used in both binary and multi-class classification problems. SVC is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is robust to overfitting when the number of features is greater than the number of samples.

Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a type of linear regression model that is used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using a logistic function.

Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between features. It calculates the probability of each class given a set of input features and selects the class with the highest probability. Naive Bayes is simple, fast, and requires a small amount of training data. It can handle a large number of features and is robust to irrelevant features. Naive Bayes is commonly used in text classification tasks such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and document categorization.

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting): XGBoost is a type of gradient boosting algorithm that builds an ensemble of weak learners (decision trees) sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of its predecessor. It uses a gradient descent optimization technique to minimize a loss function.
